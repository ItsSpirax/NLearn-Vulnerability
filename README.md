## Vulnerability

NLearn has a forgot password feature that allows you to reset your password by sending an OTP to your registered mobile number.

The website uses a four-digit code and doesn't have a captcha or rate limit, allowing anyone to brute force the code and change the password without having access to the code.

This script uses the vulnerability and sends the required requests before brute-forcing the OTP and changing the password.

I tried to find NSpira's Bug Bounty/Security E-Mail Address to report this vulnerability but I was unable to find any. So I sent the code along with the description to [info@nspira.in](mailto:info@nspira.in) but I never heard back.
